First of all, welcome to the unit and we hope you have as much fun programming, as we do, or more.

Logical reasoning is critical for computer programming. Without it, it's like playing darts in a pitch dark room.

Here, we have put together some aspects of logic that you may find useful during programming:

### Set Theory

### Number theory

#### Algebraic Number Theory

#### Computational Number Theory

### Predicate Logic

### Probablity

### Graph Theory
